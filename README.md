# houses


The purpose of this project is to create a Java program that simulates a housing development by creating objects that represent houses. The program will use object-oriented programming principles to define a House class, which will have attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and address.

The program will allow users to create and manipulate House objects, such as adding or removing bedrooms or bathrooms, changing the address, or calculating the square footage. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to interact with the House objects and see the changes they make in real-time.

To add further depth to the project, the program could incorporate features such as a database to store information about the houses, a GUI to display the houses graphically, or the ability to generate reports about the houses based on their attributes.

This project will provide a great opportunity for users to practice object-oriented programming principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, the project will require users to think critically about the design of the House class and how it should interact with other parts of the program.

By the end of this project, users should have a better understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as experience in designing and implementing a class that represents a real-world object.
